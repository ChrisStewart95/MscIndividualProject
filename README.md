# MscIndividualProject
This web app was developed for the Individual Project module of the MSc Software Development at QUB.

It allows both guitar tutors and their students to create specific accounts.

Students can link their accounts to their tutors, who can then view their progress and practice.

Students can play in three difficulty modes of a game which asks them to play a particular note on their guitar, 
then uses pitch detection and note recognition to determine whether the correct note was played.

This app also contains additional functionality, such as: forgot password; two-factor form validation;
and database data insert protection. This web app was written using PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
